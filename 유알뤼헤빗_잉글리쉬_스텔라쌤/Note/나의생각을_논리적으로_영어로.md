1. When was the time you felt so hard at work?

- The time I felt so hard happened in 2022.
- The year was when I joined my current company.
- My joining came along with a sudden change at work.
- This change was my manager's sudden quit.
- His quit gave me a lot of unfamiliar tasks and works.
- But they never gave me any time to prepare.
- This no time to prepare made me make lots of mistakes.
- These mistakes needed much more time to finish the task.
- The much more time was okay but, even with that extra effort, my result was so poor.
- That result was under my average performance of my previous works.
- It was hard for me to feel satisfied.
