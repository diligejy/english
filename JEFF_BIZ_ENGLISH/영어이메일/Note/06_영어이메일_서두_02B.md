## 2. Biz Writing 

Dear Ms. Jane,

(인사) It was nice talking to you the other day. Hope all is well.

(약속 목적) I believe we need to get together before we present our ideas on the new project. The presentation will be held next Wednesday. As you know, so we should probably have a meeting sometime this week.

(의견 수렴) Would you tell us what date and time is most suitable for you?

(일정 제안) I am fine with either tomorrow or Friday after lunch. As we have most of the data and materials in our office, it would be great to hold the meeting here.

(답장 요청) Let me know as soon as possible so we can set up the schedule. Talk to you soon.

All the best,

Pororo.
